.SYNOPSIS
    Read-only identifier-shaped residual scan. Fails the build when a non-zero
    GUID appears anywhere in the repository that the tenant placeholder manifest
    does not explicitly acquit.

.DESCRIPTION
    The IDENTIFIER-shaped half of the residual scan ratified by
    docs/adr/0055-identifier-shaped-residual-scan.md (which amends ADR 0046).

    ADR 0046 shipped a TOKEN-shaped scan
    (`contoso|onmicrosoft\.com|OWNER-PLACEHOLDER`) and claimed that "any
    remaining match is a genuine missed tenant surface". That claim was unsound.
    A token-shaped scan can only find values that string genericization
    SUBSTITUTED. It is structurally incapable of finding identifier-shaped data,
    because a raw GUID contains no token. Real Entra group object IDs sat in
    ACTIVE desired-state lists in this public template repo, and the ADR 0046
    scan could not see them -- both because the whole `data-plane/` tree was
    blanket-excluded and because the pattern could not have matched a GUID even
    if it had been scanned. This script closes that gap.

    CONTRACT -- FAIL CLOSED. Every GUID-shaped token in every tracked file is
    guilty until acquitted. A GUID is acquitted only if one of five manifest
    rules claims it:

      1. syntheticShapes    -- acquits by SHAPE (zero GUID, the zero-prefixed
                               fixture namespace, repeated-nibble fixtures, two
                               named synthetic literals). This is what replaces a
                               `tests/**` path exclusion: a fixture is acquitted
                               for LOOKING synthetic, not for LIVING in tests/.
      2. catalogKeys        -- acquits by (file, key). A GUID that is the whole
                               value of an allow-listed key in an allow-listed
                               file is a Microsoft catalog identifier (built-in
                               SIT IDs, rule-pack IDs, trainable-classifier IDs).
                               The derived VALUE SET is then citable anywhere.
      3. microsoftConstants -- acquits by exact VALUE, for constants with no
                               enclosing key (Bicep `var`, PowerShell literals,
                               prose): Entra role template IDs, Azure RBAC role
                               definition IDs, Microsoft first-party app IDs.
      4. reviewRequired     -- quarantine. Identifiers of UNRESOLVED provenance,
                               keyed by SHA-256 so the manifest never restates
                               them. Reported as `Review`, not `Finding`, and
                               pinned by a Pester test so the list cannot grow
                               quietly.
      5. committedTenantIdentifiers -- acquits by exact VALUE. Tenant-SPECIFIC IDs
                               deliberately committed as desired state because the
                               surface has no displayName the reconciler can
                               round-trip (Power BI/Fabric DLP workspace locations,
                               genericLocations principals keyed on object ID). A
                               narrow, owner-approved ADR-0023/0055 exception; each
                               entry is named + reasoned + Pester-pinned. NOT a
                               path/shape hatch -- any OTHER tenant GUID still fails.

    Anything else is a `Finding` and the script exits 1.

    There are deliberately NO path exclusions. A path exclusion is what caused
    the disclosure this script exists to prevent.

    Read-only: parses the manifest, reads tracked files (or a git ref), writes
    rows to the output stream. It never edits a file, never calls git for
    anything but enumeration/read, and never touches a tenant.

.PARAMETER ManifestPath
    Path to the tenant placeholder manifest. Defaults to the repo copy at
    .github/agents/tenant-placeholders.yaml relative to this script. Always read
    from the WORKING TREE, never from -Ref: the point of -Ref is to ask "would
    TODAY's rules have caught YESTERDAY's content?".

.PARAMETER Ref
    Scan the tree at a git ref (commit-ish) instead of the working tree. Used to
    prove the scan catches a historical disclosure -- the regression test that
    decides whether this control is real. Omit to scan the working tree.

.PARAMETER RepoRoot
    Repository root. Defaults to the parent of this script's directory.

.PARAMETER IncludeAllowed
    Also emit `Allow` rows. Off by default -- the 384 acquitted GUIDs are noise
    in CI. Useful locally to audit which rule acquitted what.

.PARAMETER FailOnReview
    Treat `Review` rows (rule 4 quarantine) as failures. Off by default so the
    quarantine does not block CI; on for the follow-up PR that empties it.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/Test-IdentifierResidue.ps1

    Scan the working tree. Exit 0 when clean.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/Test-IdentifierResidue.ps1 -Ref 1a37fbd

    Scan the tree at a historical commit using today's manifest. This is the
    regression proof: the scan MUST fail against the pre-scrub commit.

.EXAMPLE
    ./scripts/Test-IdentifierResidue.ps1 -IncludeAllowed |
        Group-Object Rule | Sort-Object Count -Descending

    Audit the allow-list: which rule is carrying how much of the repo.

            Enumerate the files to scan.

        .DESCRIPTION
            Working tree: tracked files PLUS untracked-but-not-ignored files.

            The untracked half matters and was learned the hard way. A first cut
            scanned `git ls-files` only, so a brand-new file was invisible until it
            was staged — a contributor could write a file holding a real object ID,
            run the scan, be told PASS, commit, and only then discover the leak in
            CI. A local PASS that a later commit turns into a FAIL is worse than no
            local run at all, because it is trusted. Untracked-not-ignored is what
            "about to be committed" actually means.

            Gitignored files are excluded on purpose: they never reach the remote,
            and they are where local tenant exports legitimately land (ADR 0021's
            exporter artifact directory).

            At a ref (-Ref), only the committed tree exists and the distinction is
            meaningless.
