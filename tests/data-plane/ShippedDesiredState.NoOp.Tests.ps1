    PROVE THE FIX DOES SOMETHING, AND PROVE IT DOES THE RIGHT SOMETHING.

    ADR 0056 empties every root list under data-plane/**. Two claims follow, and a
    guard test that asserts neither of them is decoration:

      CLAIM 1 (the fix works).      With the SHIPPED (empty) YAML, the reconciler
                                    plans ZERO Create / Update / Delete operations.
      CLAIM 2 (the fix is needed).  With a POPULATED YAML, the same reconciler plans
                                    CREATES. If it did not, emptying the file would
                                    have changed nothing and there was no defect.

    Claim 2 is the discriminating one and it is why this file exists. A test that only
    proved claim 1 would also pass against a reconciler that does nothing at all.

    NO TENANT IS CONTACTED. The boundary is shadowed two ways, both of which are honest
    about what they prove:

      (a) DATA. The reconciler's OWN desired-state derivation functions are lifted out
          of the script by AST and driven against the real shipped YAML on disk. This is
          the script's parser, not a re-implementation of it.

      (b) STRUCTURE. The AST is then used to prove the ORDERING and CONTAINMENT facts
          that turn "zero desired entries" into "zero operations":
            - Deploy-Labels / Deploy-AutoLabelPolicies: an early-return guard keyed on
              the empty desired list precedes EVERY tenant write, and precedes every
              tenant read in the same block. The reconciler returns before it talks to
              anything.
            - Deploy-Collections: has NO early guard (it reads the tenant first), so the
              proof is containment instead — every `Invoke-RestMethod -Method PUT` lives
              inside the switch clause for a `Create` or `Update` plan row, and the ONLY
              producer of those rows is `foreach ($d in $desiredOrdered)`. Zero desired
              entries means that loop body never executes, so no such row exists, so no
              PUT is reachable. `foreach` over an empty collection executing zero times
              is not an assumption.

    WHY THE "POPULATED" INPUT IS examples/**, NOT THE PRE-CHANGE FILE. The pre-change
    YAML carries the real lab identifiers this ADR exists to remove — a real Databricks
    workspace, a real Dataverse org, a real Entra group. Committing it under tests/ as a
    fixture would re-land the disclosure one directory over, which is the exact mistake
    ADR 0056 §Decision-6 warns about ("moving the content relocates the disclosure; it
    does not remove it"). The scrubbed examples are the same SHAPE with synthetic values,
    and shape is all claim 2 needs: a populated root list plans creates.

    The red/green matrix against `main` is the other half of this proof and it lives in
    the PR: ShippedDesiredState.Tests.ps1 FAILS against the pre-fix tree, naming the 11
    populated files. A guard that passes on the broken state is worthless.

    BRANCH AWARENESS (ADR 0057). The CLAIM 1 assertions read the SHIPPED YAML and
    assert it is empty — a property of the template branch (main) only. An
    operator spin-off populates desired state on its dev / lab branches by
    design, so CLAIM 1 skips there. CLAIM 2 and the STRUCTURE proofs read
    examples/** and the reconciler AST, hold in every copy, and never skip.
